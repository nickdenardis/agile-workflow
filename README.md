Bringing Agile to Higher Ed Without Scaring Anyone
==============

Working on the Web in higher education has its unique challenges. Regardless of your team setup, getting client feedback at each stage of a project is inefficient; too much time passes between feedback and design next steps. This type of workflow increases the possibility of mistakes and false expectations of deadlines. Nick will talk about creating an agile workflow in your environment to transform clients into partners on a project. This shift in relationship can have a major impact on the speed, accuracy, and level of work produced. Every team is different and introducing agile practices can lead to resistance. Nick will explore techniques to bring an agile workflow to a team for faster feedback loops and to produce better work.
